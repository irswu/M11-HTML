# M11-HTML

This is a full web-scraping and data analysis project. 

This project is an exercise to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. Moreover, I have scraped various types of information, including HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

This assignment consists of two technical products:
Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
